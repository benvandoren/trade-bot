This lets you have both a stop loss and target trigger trade simultaneously (ie. sell low and cut losses, or sell high and reap profit)
On an exchange you can only set one or the other, this lets you have both.

Tested with live trades and it works. Have not used extensively because day trading is too stressful!!!

- More usage described in trade-bot.py header
- Bittrex only
- Copy api-creds.cfg.sample to api-cred.cfg with real credentials
- Fill in trades.cfg and go
- Recommended test with dryRun option first
- trades.cfg file can be edited while program is running
- If condition described in trades.cfg is hit any other orders for that pair WILL BE CLEARED! 
  So if you use this script do not also set orders through website or other API calls

Run:
python3 trade-bot.py --dryrun true 




Other:
Python libraries and stuff:
python3, conda
conda create -n trade-bot python=3.5
source activate trade-bot
conda install -c anaconda requests 


when done:
source deactivate trade-bot
